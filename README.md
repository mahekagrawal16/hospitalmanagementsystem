# DocVisitNow ‚Äì Integrated Healthcare Management System

DocVisitNow is a web-based healthcare management platform designed to streamline and enhance interactions between patients, doctors, hospitals, and administrators. The system provides a centralized solution for appointment scheduling, medical history access, emergency management, and secure communication across multiple user roles.
A key innovation in DocVisitNow is its *Emergency Biometric Scanner*, which assists in identifying individuals involved in accidents by scanning their biometric data. This enables immediate access to patient details such as name, location, and emergency contact, allowing hospitals to initiate appropriate medical response and notify family members without delay.
